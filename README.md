# Chalkboard

## What's the project about ? 

Chalkboard is a social network for students and teachers. Maybe your a student, and you learn better in groups. At chalkboard we have group chats were you can create a chat, and chat with other students around the world in that same class. Group chats support videos, images, giphs, all in real time.  Say your a teacher, and you need help with how you want to get your day started. You can visit another teacher with the same class, and see what their up to. If you naturally like to help students learn, you can join the group chats and help the students out. Also, you can post anything related to education. Just give the name, description , and an optional image. People can comment on your post. Comments also support image uploading, videos, mp3s for a more exiciting enviorment. Chalkboard is currently under active development
